I'm a strategist, developer, analyst, and advisor on technology that is often Internet based (browser, mobile, tablet, etc.). Open Source courses through my veins and my work to adapt the principles, philosophies, and methodologies of Open Source to new team management and team.

A geek at heart with a business mind.

My career began early, years before graduating from college. Starting as a network administrator's assistant I grew to become an expert with Internet technologies and particularly with Open Source Software (OSS). I have worked as a Microsoft Systems Engineer and Trainer, Unix/Linux administrator, Apache/Mysql specialist, software developer, and systems analyst. My Bachelor's degree in Accounting and Master's in Financial Analysis have helped me evolve into an effective project manager, business advisor, and analyst for technology firms. I have a unique ability to create budgets, manage teams, write programming code, and speak geek to solve problems and advance goals.

## Why is this site not in Drupal?
Seems a bit odd doesn't it? I've been a Drupal [user](http://drupal.org/user/58897 "Drupal.org") , [developer](http://drupal.org/user/58897 "Drupal.org") , trainer, [author](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Drupal-Wrox-Programmer/dp/0470438525 "Amazon"), and spent three years building the [Drupal Association](http://association.drupal.org "Drupal.org"). I've dedicated over seven years of my life to Drupal. I continue to work and consultant in Drupal and I remain passionate about pushing the entire project forward. However, now I am working with academics, researchers, and the leaders and developers of other Open Source projects. Github pages provides a neutral place to host the work so that the focus can be on repeatable academic research and not on potential perceptions of bias.
