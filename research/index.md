## ABSTRACT
While open, collaborative innovation has taken root in numerous industry ecosystems, the maturing practices
followed in open source software (OSS) hold lessons for innovation resiliency. This study compares how two
OSS boundary organizations approach “community innovation,” i.e., collaborative development within a
defined ecosystem. One of their challenges is striking a balance between motivating their collection of
developers through intrinsic versus extrinsic means. We posit that getting this balance right will ensure the
source code of each project remains healthy while peripheral innovations are developed to meet specific needs
of segments in the ecosystem. We will use survey and interview data to analyze these relationships. The
findings inform the practicing manager trying to determine the appropriate incentives in the context of
community innovation.

## Introduction and Research Setting: Community Innovation and Governance
Variation

Expected to exceed $8 billion in 2013 (IDC, 2009), the popularity of open source software (OSS) is growing.
The sale of software based on open source code by value-added resellers (VARs) is now a well-established
trend (Perr, Appleyard, and Sullivan, 2010), as is the implementation of open source projects by consumers
across industries and organizations (Watson and Boudreau, 2005). Where open source was once seen as
primarily a social movement (Crowston and Wade, 2010), recent research shows that a number of projects
have a diverse and complex ecosystem built up around them that requires new ways of managing the varied
interests. Successfully doing so can help perpetuate “community innovation,” which we define as collaborative
development within an ecosystem. This research examines how boundary organizations within an ecosystem
shape community innovation by providing both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for the developers, in this
case, of open source content management systems. An apparent tension enters community innovation when
commercial interests interact with more altruistic motivations. We analyze how this tension is a false one, and,
consistent with O’Mahony and Bechky (2008), we find that seemingly contesting motivations coexist to
establish mutually beneficial working relationships. These relationships fuel both core (source code-related)
and peripheral innovations (extensions), and the trick is getting the balance right so the core platform is healthy
while the extensions meet the specific needs of the players in the ecosystem.

Community-managed OS projects collaborate within and rely upon tight social networks built-upon a fabric of
social contracts that guide interactions within the community. In its infancy an OS project is driven by a small
group of leaders that are intrinsically motivated to achieve a common goal making it easy to enforce these
social contracts. As the project gains in popularity the base of contributors must expand thus introducing
external parties and motivations. It is critical to the success of the project that the social contracts are
continually enforced to ensure that the project maintains a healthy ecosystem of collaboration and
contributions. This prevents a fork or “split” of its community and software source code, which starves a
project of the resources necessary to grow. Recognizing these particular challenges of open source projects,
boundary organizations that coordinate the developers need to understand how such projects are sustained over
time in order to support innovation of both the core software code and the extensions that build off of the core.
This paper analyzes the strategies for resilient innovation, i.e., sustained and adaptive development, of two
open source content management software projects. Joomla! and Drupal are competing projects that provide
the foundational structure for millions of websites and web applications. These two projects are comparable as
each solves a similar need in the marketplace; both utilize a community-based innovation model; and both are
licensed under the same GNU General Public License (GPL). However, they differ in how they are organized
and these governance structures have ripple effects regarding motivations within their respective communities.
Within the context of this study we define innovation as the creation of value through solutions that meet new
market needs by implementing new ideas, methods, or a different and more effective use of an existing idea.
We suggest that a healthy collaborative network will not only create innovative solutions but will sustain their
creation. To determine the health of these collaborative networks this study aims to develop a metric
comparing the health of each ecosystem over time. The linchpins of the ecosystems in our study are boundary
organizations that employ direct and indirect methods to spur innovation. In crafting their approaches to
community innovation, the two boundary organizations in our study, Joomla! and the Drupal Association,
balance the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations faced by the developers in their communities. We posit that
striking the appropriate balance ensures the core of each project remains healthy while the complementary
functionality reflected in commercial extensions fulfill specific needs of segments of the ecosystem. The
remainder of the paper introduces our conceptual framework and its usefulness for analyzing an open source

project’s activities. We present preliminary evidence from the first phase of a longitudinal field study and
discuss potential insights.

## Literature Overview
In the context of community innovation, whether it occurs upstream during blue sky exploration and standards
development or downstream in new product development, the tension between cooperation and competition
frequently surfaces. While the power of the collective mind can heighten the quality and pace of innovation
(Allen, 1983; Raymond, 1999), inter-firm collaboration often is tempered by who is going to capture the value
created (Appleyard, 1996; Schrader, 1991).
The setting of OSS does not escape this tension (Long, 2006; Shah, 2006; Shaikh and Cornford, 2010;
Staudenmayer, Tripsas, and Tucci, 2005; West, 2003). While numerous OSS projects were initially fueled by
altruistic motivations often for improved functionality at a lower price point, commercial interests typically
become more pronounced as the projects mature and ecosystems grow up around them. Our research is
focused on how cooperation and competition is balanced at the level of the people writing the code, and how
organizational structure and coordination mechanisms (Long, 2006) such as ‘boundary organizations’ link
these developers with the larger ecosystem thereby influencing this balance (O’Mahony and Bechky, 2008;
Shah, 2006). The balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can have a pronounced effect on a
developer’s willingness to contribute code (Shah, 2006).

## Conceptual Framework
Our approach to understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic motivations influence innovation in a community
setting is to examine specific defining events within the Joomla! and Drupal communities that had meaningful
impact on the source code. The underlying notion is that these events either reinforced or challenged the
(implicit) social contracts held between the developers in their respective communities. By characterizing the
events as either supporting intrinsic or extrinsic motivations and then assessing who—either the community or
the individual—captured the majority of the benefits of the resulting innovation, we can shed light on how
developer motivation to create value is associated with value capture.
One of the defining events in each community was the creation of their anchor boundary organization— Open
Source Matters in the case of Joomla! and the Drupal Association in the case of Drupal. We consider how they
have contributed to defining events in source code evolution and how their respective governance structures
influence the resiliency of the innovations core to the health of the ecosystem.
