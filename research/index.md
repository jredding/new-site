Under the guidance of and in collaboration with great professors at [Portland State University](http://pdx.edu/ "Portland State University") I'm working on a series of research that explores the forces that keep Open Source projects moving forward. Focus is primarily on the business and economic ecosystems that allow these projects to thrive. A few of the areas we look at are technological innovations, economic forces, intrinsic/extrinsic motivations, community models, and business models. This research builds upon existing research from many scholars, who I have listed at the bottom of this page. 

The current research project is entitled: "Fostering Resilent Community Innovation: How Boundary Organizations balance Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation"
