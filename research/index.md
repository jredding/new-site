title: Fostering Resilent Community Innovation

Under the guidance of and in collaboration with great professors at [Portland State University](http://pdx.edu/ "Portland State University") I'm working on a series of research that explores the forces that keep Open Source projects moving forward. Focus is primarily on the business and economic ecosystems that allow these projects to thrive. A few of the areas we look at are technological innovations, economic forces, intrinsic/extrinsic motivations, community models, and business models. This research builds upon existing research from many scholars, who I have listed at the bottom of this page. 

The current research project is entitled: "Fostering Resilent Community Innovation: How Boundary Organizations balance Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation"

## Abstract of current paper
While open, collaborative innovation has taken root in numerous industry ecosystems, the maturing practices
followed in open source software (OSS) hold lessons for innovation resiliency. This study compares how two
OSS boundary organizations approach “community innovation,” i.e., collaborative development within a
defined ecosystem. One of their challenges is striking a balance between motivating their collection of
developers through intrinsic versus extrinsic means. We posit that getting this balance right will ensure the
source code of each project remains healthy while peripheral innovations are developed to meet specific needs
of segments in the ecosystem. We will use survey and interview data to analyze these relationships. The
findings inform the practicing manager trying to determine the appropriate incentives in the context of
community innovation.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants
Several great professors and schools have begun to study and teach Open Source models within their classrooms and schools. The following professors have influenced our work
