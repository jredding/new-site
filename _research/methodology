Our initial research focuses on an attempt to provide a measurement of the health of an ecosystem through the use of qualitative and quantitative methods. This mixed methods approach to our fieldwork will allow us to better understand the project ecosystem in order to provide a measurement that can be replicated and used on varying projects. 

Below we describe the different methods employed.

<h2>Quantitative Methods</h2>
Quantitative data such as usage statistics, commit statistics, economic data (ex. # of companies, size of company, etc.), and responses to online surveys will be used to provide insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the community. Data is obtained by querying publicly accessible code repositories, public websites, and requesting additionally non-sensitive data through community and project leaders. The data is used to find correlations or trends that have an effect on the contributions to a project and the innovative features built into the project. 

<h2>Qualitative Methods</h2>
Qualitative data such as interviews, observation of meetings/code sprints/conference social events, and document analysis will help us to triangulate our rich descriptions. 

We begin by focusing on a series of illustrative episodes obtained through press releases, blog posts, Internet searches, and personal interviews. These illustrative episodes are then cataloged and presented to key members of each project to determine what each episode represented (increased/decreased collaboration, type of motivation, innovation, etc.). Each person interviewed is requested to comment on the list of illustrative episodes and may remove or add episodes. 

 This analysis provides a base measurement of the project’s health to determine the positive or negative effects of activities performed by boundary organizations and insight into how these projects create value for their communities by eliciting and sustaining innovation. The goal is to determine the impact that boundary organizations and the enforcement of social contracts have on sustaining innovation within an open source project.

<h2>Finding the sweet-spot</h2>
In subsequent phases we will observe the quality and quantity of innovations occurring within the innovation ecosystem over the same period of time to determine if there is a health “sweet-spot” wherein a high level of innovation occurs. We will also review the effect of actions taken by boundary organizations to gain an understanding of how ecosystems can be shifted by their respective boundary organizations.

<h2>Interviews</h2>
Personal interviews are conducted to validate the list of illustrative events and to obtain qualitative information and data about the project's history and primary motivational factors. Subjects include members of the two open source projects (Drupal and Joomla!) who have been involved in development of the software itself and/or supporting efforts.  Initial interviews are conducted with highly involved members of each project, identified through public postings or self identification.

<h3>Number of interviews</h3>
10-15 project members of the Drupal community;
10-15 project members of the Joomla! community

<h3>Interview process</h3>
Each interview session will last approximately one hour during which time the researcher will walk the interviewee through a series of structured questions. Utilizin the real-time collaboration tool Google Drive the interviewee will be presented with a collaborative spreadsheet containing a series of illustrative episodes and a collaborative note taking document to ensure data the interview was captured accurately. The interviewee will be requested to comment on the list of illustrative episodes and allowed to add or remove episodes until a list they believe to be representative of the history of the project is obtained. 

Upon consent of the interviewee the session audio will be recorded. 
 
The researchers may request additional interviews with the same individuals, or those holding the same roles, over time to follow changes in perceptions and characteristics of the open source project over time.  There will be no more than 4 interviews with any one individual throughout the duration of the study.
Recruitment for interviews is purposive and designed to include diverse perspectives on the open source projects.  Interviewees will be selected based on their influence within the open source project.
